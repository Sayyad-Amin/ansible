# ansible

### Ansible is an open-source configuration management, application deployment, and automation tool. It allows infrastructure as code (IaC) and uses an agentless architecture over SSH.

### Ansible uses SSH (for Linux) and WinRM (for Windows) to communicate with managed nodes.
### It runs playbooks (written in YAML) that define tasks.
### It executes idempotent operations to ensure system consistency.
